\section{Traffic Congestion}
\label{sec:traffic_congestion}

In this section I will talk about traffic congestion, its socioeconomic and environmental impacts as well as describe some works on the matter.

\section{Traffic Simulation}
\label{sec:traffic_simulation}

In this section I will talk about traffic simulation and describe a few papers on this topic.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Talk about SUMO
	\item Talk about VISSIM
	\item Talk about other papers that used simulation
\end{itemize}

\section{Machine Learning and Deep Learning}
\label{sec:machine_learning_and_deep_learning}

In this section I will talk about a few machine learning algorithms and their applications. Also, I will talk about what deep learning is, some techniques and which of the two (ML/DL) has the greatest potential to working with traffic prediction.
