## Jupyter Notebooks
- 000_number_of_readings
    - Shows number of queries made everyday
    - Shows number of queries made monthly
- 005_area_of_interest
    - Plots each unique set of coordinates provided by TomTom regarding the area that was used to provide the speed and travel time data
- 010_current_speed
    - 010_current_speed_all_months
        - Shows the mean speed value for each month and a confidence interval
    - 010_current_speed_sampled_month
        - Samples a random month using Pandas' df.sample() method to randomly get a month
        - Shows the actual speed values recorded for that month
    - 010_current_speed_sampled_day
        - Samples another random row from the dataframe
        - Shows the actual speed value for a specific day (24h)
    - 010_current_speed_month_and_dow_mean
        - Shows the mean speed value for every day of the week of every month collected
    - 010_current_speed_month_and_dow_median
        - Similar to 010_current_speed_month_and_dow_mean, shows median instead of mean
        - Mean shows the centre point of the list of values
- 020_current_travel_time
    - 020_current_travel_time_all_months
        - Shows the mean travel time value for each month and a confidence interval
    - 020_current_travel_time_sampled_month
        - Samples a random month using Pandas' df.sample() method to randomly get a month
        - Shows the actual travel time values recorded for that month
    - 020_current_travel_time_sampled_day
        - Samples another random row from the dataframe
        - Shows the actual travel speed value for a specific day (24h)
    - 020_current_travel_time_month_and_dow_mean
        - Shows the mean travel time value for every day of the week of every month collected
    - 020_current_travel_time_month_and_dow_median
        - Similar to 020_current_travel_time_month_and_dow_mean, shows median instead of mean
        - Mean shows the centre point of the list of values
- 030_current_speed_vs_free_flow
    - 030_current_speed_vs_free_flow
        - Shows the comparison between the current speed vs. the speed when there is no traffic
- 040_current_travel_time_vs_free_flow
    - 040_current_travel_time_vs_free_flow
        - Shows the comparison between the current travel time vs. the time when there is no traffic
- 050_current_speed_vs_current_travel_time
    - 050_current_speed_vs_travel_time
        - Compares the values for current speed and current travel time
- 060_free_flow_speed_vs_free_flow_travel_time
    - 060_free_flow_speed_vs_travel_time
        - Compares the values for free flow speed and free flow travel time
- 070_correlations
    - 070_speed_travel_time_correlation
        - Plots a heatmap with the correlations between current and free flow speed and travel time
        - Correlation type used is Pearson
